Hi,
Custom Kernel releases for Mi 11 Lite 4G
Based on OpenELA 4.14y (v4.14.356-openela-rc1) kernel with device specific modifications and some spoofing for Custom Roms

Options-
1. "NoRoot-Custom" - Non-Rooted Kernel for Custom ROMs.
2. "NoRoot-MIUI" - Non-Rooted Kernel for MIUI ROMs.
3. "KernelSU-Next-Custom" - Kernel with KernelSU Next + SuSFS 1.5.5 implementation for Custom ROMs.
4. "KernelSU-Next-MIUI" - Kernel with KernelSU Next + SuSFS 1.5.5 implementation for MIUI ROMs.
5. "SukiSU-Ultra-Custom" - Kernel with SukiSU Ultra + SuSFS 1.5.5 implementation for Custom ROMs.
6. "SukiSU-Ultra-MIUI" - Kernel with SukiSU Ultra + SuSFS 1.5.5 implementation for MIUI ROMs.
7. "OnlySuSFS-Custom" - Kernel with only SuSFS 1.5.5 implemented for Custom ROMs.
8. "OnlySuSFS-MIUI" - Kernel with only SuSFS 1.5.5 implemented for MIUI ROMs. Why these only SuSFS builds if        you may ask, tbh I am not sure too...
